# Substring search algorithms


### Overview
This project is for practice in implementing the different substring algorithms I have been learning about.
The implemented algos can be found in the project documentation.


### Motivation
I am planning a personal project that might grow into something big and right now, I wanted to learn how to make nice features like an internal search engine (or similar). This (and other ideas I have) requires knowledge of a lot of algorithms and substring searches are a prominent part of that list.


### Project Structure
 * This is a Maven project with the usual Maven folder structure.
 * The classes in the target folder are generated by Maven's compilation command.
 * The tests run are for Junit 5 (Jupiter).
 * The resources folder in src/main and src/test are not working as of yet, I will troubleshoot this later when I dive deeper into learning about Junit 5 and Logback.
